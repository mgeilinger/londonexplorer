            <p>You are in a quaint residential square. A pub sits on the corner with hanging flower baskets on its front an a painted wooden sign reading 'The Boar's Head'. Inside the pub you make out the hunched figure of Sir Archibald Baxter.</p>
            <p>To the west is Marylebone, to the east is Bloomsbury and to the south is Soho.</p>
            <p id="convo">You cross the floor of the pub to speak with Sir Archibald. Even though he's sat down you can tell he's a man of small stature. He sits hunched over his pint of ale. "What do you want?" he says. He appears drunk. "I've already been interviewed. I told the police everything I know about the murder. I'm leaving town tomorrow. I'm going to Belize."</p>

                <p>Yesterday morning, the famous thoroughbred horse, Silver Patch, and his trainer, Oscar Swift, were found dead in the horse’s stall at the Cosgrove Stables.</p>
                <p>The horse had been poisoned; and the trainer had been hit over the head and stabbed to repeatedly with a sharp object.</p>
                <p>Silver Patch, so named for the patch of silver hair on his mane, was owned by Sir Reginald Cosgrove, a breeder who also owns four other horses.</p>
                <p>Person routinely questioned by Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard include Sir Reginald Cosgrove and his petite wife, Madame Hilda Cosgrove; the Cosgrove cook, Mrs. Maggie Doan; Mrs. Doan’s husband, house painter Henry Doan; and rival horse breeder, Sir Archibald Baxter. Scotland Yard is also looking for one Bobby Jansen, a stable boy who left the Cosgrove’s employ, unhappily, about a month ago.</p>
                <p>The only clues discovered at the scene of the crime were some broken pieces of glass from the bottom of an ale bottle and a pawnbroker’s ticket. The floor of Silver Patch’s stall also contained a few drops of fresh, black paint.</p>
                <p>Unable to develop a solid lead, Inspector Gregson has come to you. Gregson wants to know a) who killed the horse and the trainer, b) the weapon used to kill the trainer, and c) the motive.</p>
