            <p>You are on a quiet street with a row of elegant townhouses, all clothed in stucco. On the corner of the road sits a newsagent. The storefront is adorned with colorful displays of newspapers, magazines, and boxes of snacks. The proprietor nods a greeting as you pass by.</p>
            <p>To the west is Kensington, to the north is Hyde Park, to the east is Westminster and to the south is Chelsea.</p>
            <p id="convo">You speak with the shop proprietor. "If you're looking for Sir Archibald, he can be found in the pub up in Fitzrovia, the Boar's Head. He's a miserable fella. Spent most of his career losing races to Sir Reginald's horse, Silver Patch. They're bitter rivals. He was almost bankrupted by his recent losing streak.</p>

                <p>Yesterday morning, the famous thoroughbred horse, Silver Patch, and his trainer, Oscar Swift, were found dead in the horse’s stall at the Cosgrove Stables.</p>
                <p>The horse had been poisoned; and the trainer had been hit over the head and stabbed to repeatedly with a sharp object.</p>
                <p>Silver Patch, so named for the patch of silver hair on his mane, was owned by Sir Reginald Cosgrove, a breeder who also owns four other horses.</p>
                <p>Person routinely questioned by Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard include Sir Reginald Cosgrove and his petite wife, Madame Hilda Cosgrove; the Cosgrove cook, Mrs. Maggie Doan; Mrs. Doan’s husband, house painter Henry Doan; and rival horse breeder, Sir Archibald Baxter. Scotland Yard is also looking for one Bobby Jansen, a stable boy who left the Cosgrove’s employ, unhappily, about a month ago.</p>
                <p>The only clues discovered at the scene of the crime were some broken pieces of glass from the bottom of an ale bottle and a pawnbroker’s ticket. The floor of Silver Patch’s stall also contained a few drops of fresh, black paint.</p>
                <p>Unable to develop a solid lead, Inspector Gregson has come to you. Gregson wants to know a) who killed the horse and the trainer, b) the weapon used to kill the trainer, and c) the motive.</p>
