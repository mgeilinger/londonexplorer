            <p>You are stood opposite the entrance to a museum. Large ionic columns tower along the grand wings of the building. In the grand vestibule, upon entering, the museum's Curator of Arts is waiting to speak with you.</p>
            <p>To the west is Fitzrovia, to the southeast is Holborn and to the southwest is Covent Garden.</p>
            <p id="convo">You speak with the museum's Curator of Arts and enquire about Sir Reginald's recent dealings. "Yes, I know Reggie very well," he tells you. "We went to school together. Dreadful business about his horse. The trainer died as well? What a pity. I saw him just the other day in fact. He was looking to sell some of his more expensive artwork. Unortunately, we couldn't verify the painting was a genuine. I think he may have been scammed when he originally bought it, the poor thing. Not for repeating, but he was very ill tempered when our team reported it to be a fake. It's rumoured he's having money troubles lately."</p>

                <p>Yesterday morning, the famous thoroughbred horse, Silver Patch, and his trainer, Oscar Swift, were found dead in the horse’s stall at the Cosgrove Stables.</p>
                <p>The horse had been poisoned; and the trainer had been hit over the head and stabbed to repeatedly with a sharp object.</p>
                <p>Silver Patch, so named for the patch of silver hair on his mane, was owned by Sir Reginald Cosgrove, a breeder who also owns four other horses.</p>
                <p>Person routinely questioned by Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard include Sir Reginald Cosgrove and his petite wife, Madame Hilda Cosgrove; the Cosgrove cook, Mrs. Maggie Doan; Mrs. Doan’s husband, house painter Henry Doan; and rival horse breeder, Sir Archibald Baxter. Scotland Yard is also looking for one Bobby Jansen, a stable boy who left the Cosgrove’s employ, unhappily, about a month ago.</p>
                <p>The only clues discovered at the scene of the crime were some broken pieces of glass from the bottom of an ale bottle and a pawnbroker’s ticket. The floor of Silver Patch’s stall also contained a few drops of fresh, black paint.</p>
                <p>Unable to develop a solid lead, Inspector Gregson has come to you. Gregson wants to know a) who killed the horse and the trainer, b) the weapon used to kill the trainer, and c) the motive.</p>
