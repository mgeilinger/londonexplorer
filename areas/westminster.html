            <p>You are on a bustling corner overlooking a large gothic parliamentary building. A sea of smartly dressed office workers moves in waves around you. The air is filled with the sound of traffic, punctuated by the occasional blare of horns and the rumble of buses.</p>
            <p>To the west is Belgravia, to the northwest is Mayfair, to the north is Soho, to the northeast is Covent Garden and to the southwest is Chelsea.</p>

                <p>A strange preacher had come to town, a large Moroccan-bound Bible under his arm. Scotland Yard is puzzled when the preacher is found stabbed to death on his balcony seat at the Playhouse during a performance of Hamlet.</p>
                <p>The Duchess of Tallcourt, who accompanied the victim to the Theatre, discovered the body upon returning from the powder room after the interval. The preacher's Bible was gone; and on the floor nearby were a German made cigarette anda a packet of aspiring.</p>
                <p>It was common knowledge that the Duchess, previously a benefactor of the Bishop of Whittenfroth, had come to support the new preacher's views. This greatly angered the Bishop and the Duke of Tallcourt.</p>
                <p>The Longworth Acting Troupe was performing the play; the Earl of Longworth in the lead. Longworth, a rascally cad, had been wooing the Duchess' daughter, Anastasia, in hopes of gaining support for his poverty-stricken troupe.</p>
                <p>You are tasked with discovering a) who killed the preacher, b) the weapon and c) the motive.</p>
