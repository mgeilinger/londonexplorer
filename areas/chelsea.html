            <p>You are stood on a street lined with large Victorian houses. Before you is a quiant artist's studio with a large central window adorning the front of the building. Further down the road, nestled between the other homes, is a small chemist shop. By it's side is the Doan's residence - a smaller home than the general grandeur of the street. It looks slightly delapidated.</p>
            <p>To the north is Kensington, to the northeast is Belgravia and to the east is Westminster.</p>
            <p id="convo">You knock on the door and are quickly greated by Mrs Maggie Doan. "Henry's out buying paint, but I can speak to you. He's missing some tubs and he's got a job this afternoon. I was actually worried you were going to be our landlord. He's has been harassing us non-stop. I don't think it's legal the amount he visits us unannounced and I'm wondering whether I should report it."</p>

                <p>Yesterday morning, the famous thoroughbred horse, Silver Patch, and his trainer, Oscar Swift, were found dead in the horse’s stall at the Cosgrove Stables.</p>
                <p>The horse had been poisoned; and the trainer had been hit over the head and stabbed to repeatedly with a sharp object.</p>
                <p>Silver Patch, so named for the patch of silver hair on his mane, was owned by Sir Reginald Cosgrove, a breeder who also owns four other horses.</p>
                <p>Person routinely questioned by Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard include Sir Reginald Cosgrove and his petite wife, Madame Hilda Cosgrove; the Cosgrove cook, Mrs. Maggie Doan; Mrs. Doan’s husband, house painter Henry Doan; and rival horse breeder, Sir Archibald Baxter. Scotland Yard is also looking for one Bobby Jansen, a stable boy who left the Cosgrove’s employ, unhappily, about a month ago.</p>
                <p>The only clues discovered at the scene of the crime were some broken pieces of glass from the bottom of an ale bottle and a pawnbroker’s ticket. The floor of Silver Patch’s stall also contained a few drops of fresh, black paint.</p>
                <p>Unable to develop a solid lead, Inspector Gregson has come to you. Gregson wants to know a) who killed the horse and the trainer, b) the weapon used to kill the trainer, and c) the motive.</p>
