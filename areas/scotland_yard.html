                        <p>Sir Reginald painted over the silver patch on the mane of his prize horse, and painted a silver patch on the mane of Night Dancer, another of his horses. He then switched stalls and poisoned Night Dancer, who now looked like Silver Patch.</p>

When Switt refused to go along with Sir Reginaldâ€™s plan to kill Night Dancer, Sir Reginald became enraged and killed the trainer, hitting him over the head with an ale bottle and then stabbing him repeatedly with the broken bottle Killer: Sir Reginald Cosgrove; Motive: Insurance.</p>
