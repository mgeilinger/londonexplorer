                    <p>A strange preacher had come to town, a large Moroccan-bound Bible under his arm. Scotland Yard is puzzled when the preacher is found stabbed to death on his balcony seat at the Playhouse during a performance of Hamlet.</p>
                    <p>The Duchess of Tallcourt, who accompanied the victim to the Theatre, discovered the body upon returning from the powder room after the interval. The preacher's Bible was gone; and on the floor nearby were a German made cigarette anda a packet of aspiring.</p>
                    <p>It was common knowledge that the Duchess, previously a benefactor of the Bishop of Whittenfroth, had come to support the new preacher's views. This greatly angered the Bishop and the Duke of Tallcourt.</p>
                    <p>The Longworth Acting Troupe was performing the play; the Earl of Longworth in the lead. Longworth, a rascally cad, had been wooing the Duchess' daughter, Anastasia, in hopes of gaining support for his poverty-stricken troupe.</p>
                    <p>You are tasked with discovering a) who killed the preacher, b) the weapon and c) the motive.</p>
                    <p>Your train pulls into Marylebone Station. Speak to people in the local area to gain information that may lead you to solving the case.</p>
