                        <p>Yesterday morning, the famous thoroughbred horse, Silver Patch, and his trainer, Oscar Swift, were found dead in the horse’s stall at the Cosgrove Stables. You have been tasked with solving the case.</p>
                        <p>The horse had been poisoned; and the trainer had been hit over the head and stabbed to repeatedly with a sharp object.</p>
                        <p>Silver Patch, so named for the patch of silver hair on his mane, was owned by Sir Reginald Cosgrove, a breeder who also owns four other horses.</p>
                        <p>Person routinely questioned by Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard include Sir Reginald Cosgrove and his petite wife, Madame Hilda Cosgrove; the Cosgrove cook, Mrs. Maggie Doan; Mrs. Doan’s husband, house painter Henry Doan; and rival horse breeder, Sir Archibald Baxter. Scotland Yard is also looking for one Bobby Jansen, a stable boy who left the Cosgrove’s employ, unhappily, about a month ago.</p>
                        <p>The only clues discovered at the scene of the crime were some broken pieces of glass from the bottom of an ale bottle and a pawnbroker’s ticket. The floor of Silver Patch’s stall also contained a few drops of fresh, black paint.</p>
                        <p>Unable to develop a solid lead, Inspector Gregson has come to you. Gregson wants to know a) who killed the horse and the trainer and b) the motive.</p>

                        <p>You can gather more clues by speaking to people around London. To get you started, two witnesses that have information pertaining to the case may be found in Soho and Kensington. The Doan's house can be found in their home in Chelsea and the Cosgroves live in an apartment in Mayfair.</p>
                        <p>Once you think you know who the killer is, head to Scotland Yard in Westminster and submit your theory. Once you've begun submitting your theory you won't be able to leave again, so make sure you've spoken to everyone before committing to this. Once you've stated your solution, you'll also be provided with the correct answer for comparison.</p>
                        <p>Directions for the surrounding areas are given in each district, but you may also access a map of the area by pressing the 'check map' button at the bottom of the page.</p>

                        <p>Press the 'start' button below as soon as you're ready and you'll board a train headed for Marylebone Station.</p>
                        <p>Good luck!</p>
